Check out the Rails API backend for this project at https://github.com/daphinora/Quotes_backend.

Welcome to The Quote Sentimentalyzer! The Quote Sentimentalyzer encourages a user to save quotes to a collection and then analyze their overall sentiment (positive, negative, and neutral) based on the quotes the user has selected. The Quote Sentimentalyzer was a mod 3 project by three students at Flatiron School, and thus has met MVP (minimum viable product) representation but not been further planned upon.

Stretch goals for this project include:
1. Fixing the styling/buttons
2. Allowing users to add their own quotes
3. Allowing users to create multiple collections
4. Allowing users to view other users' collections
5. Implementing user authentication
